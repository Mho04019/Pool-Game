## Description

This project is a basic pool game implemented in Python using the Pygame library for graphics and Pymunk for physics simulations. The game includes a pool table, balls, a cue, and basic game mechanics such as potting balls and tracking lives.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive pool game mechanics.
- Physics simulation using Pymunk.
- Basic GUI using Pygame.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pygame-pool-game.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
